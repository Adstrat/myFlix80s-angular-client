# MyFlixAngularClient

myFlixAngularClient is an app developed with Angular.  It provides users with information about different films, directors and genres from the 1980s. Users can sign up, update their information and add films to a list of favourites. 

Here is the link to the [myFlix80s Angular App](https://adstrat.github.io/myFlix80s-angular-client/welcome).

It was developed using the [myFlix-API](https://github.com/Adstrat/myFlix80s).

The project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.0.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
